# What's ArmourTraders?  
       ArmourTraders is a secured transaction tool that solves the problem of trust in online transactions .
       ArmourTraders enables people to exchange anything by using cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner.
# Why ArmourTraders?
        Traditional centralized exchanges lack openness, transparency. After the financial crisis, over-the-counter trading has become a trend. The core problem of OTC transactions is that the credit risk management mechanism is insufficient, and there is no effective means to ensure the safety of transactions.
        ArmourTraders completes the construction of OTC transaction trust and ensures transaction security through immutable smart contracts and a decentralized dispute resolution model.
